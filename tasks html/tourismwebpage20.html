        Canada is a vast and beautiful country, 
        bordering three oceans and encompassing nearly every landscape on earth, 
        from temperate rainforest to high arctic. In between those wild places you’ll find 
        cosmopolitan cities and authentic towns brimming with culture and history.

        It’s also one of the top places to visit, according to CNN Travel, 
        thanks to our Indigenous culture, access to the Northern Lights, the chill surf town of Tofino, 
        and the new Fundy Trail Parkway in New Brunswick.
