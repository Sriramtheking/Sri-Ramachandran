        <p>Boxing (also known as "western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport and a martial art in which two people, 
        usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, 
        throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.

<p>The early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, 
    Japanese polymath and educator Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎, Jigoro Kano, 1860–1938), 
    born Shinnosuke Jigorō (新之助 治五郎, Jigorō Shinnosuke). 
    Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. 
    His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the Shinto Hiyoshi shrine in Shiga Prefecture.</p>
